## Scenario
 Suppose you are a fitness trainer and nutritionist. You have to deal with three clients. For each client, you have to design their exercise and diet plan. created a "Health Management System."

created a "Health Management System" to manage and save your exercises and food details in a separate files with the time you entered it record with it automatically for you to retrive it later
program will generate files automatially 


## Instructions:
* Create a food log file for each client
* Create an exercise log file for each client.
* Ask the user whether they want to log or retrieve client data.
* Write a function that takes the user input of the client's name. After the client's name is entered, it will display a message as **"What you want to log- Diet or Exercise".**
